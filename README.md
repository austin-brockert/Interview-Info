I used `@clerk/clerk-react` in this project.

The `@clerk/clerk-react` package is a React library provided by Clerk to integrate authentication, user management, and other user-related features into your React application easily.

Here's a breakdown of what `Clerk` offers and how you can use it in other projects:

`Authentication:` Clerk handles various authentication methods, including email and password, social logins, and multi-factor authentication. It provides pre-built components for sign-in, sign-up, user profile management, and more.

`User Management:` With Clerk, you can manage user sessions and handle user data securely. It simplifies common tasks like user verification, password recovery, and profile updates.

`React Integration:` The library is designed specifically for React, making it straightforward to integrate into your existing React applications. It provides hooks and components that fit naturally into React's component lifecycle.

`Customization:` Clerk components are customizable, allowing you to match the look and feel of your application while maintaining a high level of security and functionality.

`Secure and Compliant:` Clerk ensures that your authentication flows are secure and compliant with current standards and regulations, reducing the burden on your team to manage these aspects.
